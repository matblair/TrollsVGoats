Welcome to Trolls Vs. Goats. Place your trolls to stop the insidious goats from pushing through your gate. Finish with a completely balanced gate (0 Nm) to win. Let the moment go over 20 Nm and the goats will get through. Each lane is an extra meter from the pivot and your standard troll pushes with a force of 2 N.
